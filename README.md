## Included Vim plugins

I try to use built-in features instead of plugins (i.e. netrw > nerdtree). The plugins that I do use are:

- [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/): code-completion as you type.
- [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic): syntax checker.

- [vim-airplane](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline): more info on the statusline.
- [python-mode](https://github.com/klen/python-mode): makes Python development a breeze.
- [vim-json](https://github.com/elzr/vim-json): better `JSON` highlighting and folding.
